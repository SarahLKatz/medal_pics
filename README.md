## About
An app that allows users to input a race, date and location, and when they log in after the race, they will be shown some pictures taken nearby that can serve as inspiration for their post-race medal pictures.

The app can be accessed at [https://racemedalpics.herokuapp.com/](https://racemedalpics.herokuapp.com/).
